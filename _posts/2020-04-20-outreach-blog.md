Last year a few fellow PhD students and I coorganised an outreach event at the University of WÃ¼rzburg. We invited a class from my former high school, the Deutschhaus Gymnasium, to an afternoon of quantum technologies. It was a fun learning experience for all, not least due to the enthusiasm of the high school students.

Afterwards I wrote a recap on our shared blogging platform, have a look!
