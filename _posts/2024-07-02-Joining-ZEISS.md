I'm happy to share that I joined ZEISS SMT as a computational imaging scientist in April 2024. Fun fact: ZEISS is the only company currently capable of designing and manufacturing the extreme-ultraviolet lithography optics required for current leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing. I'm very excited to join this effort and contribute to further scaling of the compute power and efficiency of the latest chips!
