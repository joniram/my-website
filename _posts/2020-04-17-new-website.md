Welcome to my new website, launched today. 

Since all of the UK is stuck at home during lockdown, it's finally time to work on my own website. 
For me there are two main driving factors behind this: 
* Learn more about the involved technologies. There are many options when it comes to designing and hosting a website.
For now I've settled on using Github Pages, combined with Jekyll. 
* Have my own presence on the web. I think it's always a pleasant surprise when, while googling another scientist, to find a website with some extra context and how their research fits within their overall interests.

So here we are!
