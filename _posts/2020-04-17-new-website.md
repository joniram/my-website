Welcome to my new website, launched today. 

Since all of the UK is stuck at home during lockdown, it's finally time to work on my own website. 
There are many reasons to have one. For me the two main factors are these: 
<!--more-->
* Learning more about the involved technologies. There are many options when it comes to designing and hosting a website. I didn't want an entirely off-the-shelf solution like Wordpress. So for now I've settled on using Github Pages, combined with Jekyll. The process is still fairly streamlined thanks to the many helpful resources online, but I have already learned a lot while setting this up.

* Having my own presence on the web. A major part of research is about disseminating the results. I think it's always a pleasant surprise to find a website with some extra context on other people's results and how their research fits within their overall interests. Thus I'm hoping to provide some similar insights here.


So here we are! 
Finally, a note on German umlaut characters (such as the ü in Müller): These days it's possible to have Unicode characters including umlauts in your domain address. However, of course most people would struggle to find the ü on their keyboard. And then there are the [security implications of Unicode characters in your domain](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/chrome-firefox-and-opera-users-beware-this-isnt-the-apple-com-you-want/). So I settled on the official ASCII representation of Mueller to make www.jramueller.com.
