Welcome to my new website, launched today. 

Since all of the UK is stuck at home during lockdown, it's finally time to work on my own website. 
For me there are two main driving factors behind this: 

* Learning more about the involved technologies. There are many options when it comes to designing and hosting a website.
For now I've settled on using Github Pages, combined with Jekyll. 

* Having my own presence on the web. A major part of research is about disseminating the results. I think it's always a pleasant surprise to find a website with some extra context on other peoples results and how their research fits within their overall interests. 


So here we are! 
Finally, a note on German umlaut characters (such as the ü in Müller): These days it's possible to have Unicode characters including umlauts in your domain address. However, of course most people would struggle to find the ü on their keyboard. And then there are the [security implications of UNICODE characters in your domain](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/chrome-firefox-and-opera-users-beware-this-isnt-the-apple-com-you-want/). So I settled on the official ASCII representation of Mueller to make www.jramueller.com.
