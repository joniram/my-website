I'm excited to share that I've been promoted to Senior Research Scientist at Toshiba, starting from next month.

I will continue on the development of solid-state lidar transmitters using semiconductor photonic integrated circuits.
Two and a half years ago, we started this new research topic with me as the sole full-time staff member, defining the scope of the project, performing feasibility studies, and beginning the computational modelling to demonstrate the commerical value of our endeavour. By now, our team has expanded significantly with a total of four people working full-time, and a fifth colleague contributing half  of her time to the project. It's great to see how far we've come in this time, and to see the research progressing towards the ambitious goals we've set out!
