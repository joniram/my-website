I grew up in Würzburg, Germany's wine capital.

Fun fact: Würzburg is (claimed to be) home to the oldest drinkable bottle of wine in the world.
Consequently, we recently ventured into the art of wine making at home, setting up a rhubarb wine.
We started at the end of June, and it's been aging along since. Fingers crossed!
