<!-- # About -->

<p>
I'm a computational imaging scientist at ZEISS SMT, investigating optical imaging techniques for next-generation semiconductor manufacturing.
Previously I was a (senior) research scientist at the Cambridge Research Laboratory of Toshiba&nbsp;Europe, resarching integrated photonics. I'm passionate about cutting-edge technology in semiconductors, optics, and machine learning.

During my PhD I developed quantum-dot-based LEDs suitable for quantum information applications, in particular for quantum communication. I also hold an MSc and a BSc from TU Munich, focussing on semiconductor physics and optics.
