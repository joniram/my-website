<!-- # About -->
<div>
<p>
I'm a researcher at the Cambridge Research Laboratory of Toshiba&nbsp;Europe, currently developing novel solid-state lidar sensors based on semiconductor lasers.
</p>
<p>
My PhD research was completed back in 2020.
During my PhD I developed quantum-dot-based LEDs suitable for quantum information applications, in particular for quantum communication. I also hold an MSc and a BSc from TU Munich, focussing on semiconductor physics.
